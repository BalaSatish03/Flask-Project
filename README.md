This project aims to develop a Flask-based application to efficiently ingest JSON records into Elasticsearch while also constructing APIs to facilitate seamless data retrieval.
Leveraging Flask, a micro web framework in Python, in conjunction with Elasticsearch, a powerful distributed search and analytics engine, enables the creation of an efficient data pipeline and user-friendly interfaces.
